"reliance jio on sunday welcomed bharti airtel s decision to provide better interconnection for its calls but it also said the number of such points proposed remained substantially less than actual requirement and these won t be able to address the issue of large scale call drops airtel rebutted in a counter statement based on the current traffic flow between the two networks the proposed augmentation by airtel would still only suffice for less than one fourth of the required interconnection capacity a jio statement said more than two crore calls are failing everyday between the two networks which is far in excess of the quality of service parameters and of alarming proportions urgent steps are required to be taken in the interest of customers of both operators the statement said it is unfortunate that the telecom regulatory authority s intervention was required for airtel to resume augmentation of points of interconnection which it ought to have done by itself in compliance with its licence terms the statement comes a day after airtel said it has received the payments due on interconnection from jio and that after executing the agreed augmentation in such points their total number will be three times that at present it also said the capacity will be sufficient to serve over 15 million jio customers and added it will be much more than jio s subscriber base while the interconnect agreement provides for a commissioning period of 90 days from the day reliance jio makes the payment airtel will work towards releasing the points of interconnect well ahead of the contractual obligation said airtel but this point was refuted by jio the telecom regulatory authority of india s regulation does not provide for 90 days to adhere to quality of service parameters the authority in fact instructed the incumbent operators to urgently provide requisite interconnection capacities to maintain quality of service parameters and not to make this subject to any contingencies or restrictions jio also found fault with the type of interconnection points airtel was offering and said it was a clear case of abuse of market dominance it appears that the quality of service will continue to suffer and indian customers will be denied the benefits of superior and free voice services as a result of such anti competitive behaviour but airtel in a statement later charged jio with dillydallying on the issue and deliberately not cooperating on interconnection it also said such complaints may be a ploy by jio to cover up some technical issues in their own network this was again refuted by jio in another statement later on sunday while calling airtel s rebuttal misleading and unfortunate while there are over two crore call failures every day between the two networks jio to airtel there are no incidents of call failures within the jio network the jio statement said it added that the company not only wanted subscribers to enjoy high definition jio to jio calls but was also invited third party independent assesses like the resource and monitoring wing of the telecom department to confirm the veracity of its claims another issue of contention has been portability jio said the rival has been blocking mobile number portability for migration of potential airtel subscribers to jiobut the other side maintained that all requests were being processed as per guidelines"

"new delhi it was the year of the big bang in telecom reliance jio s disruptive entry into the sector threw an unorthodox gauntlet at its rivals triggering a bruising war of words and tariffs among players but it was also the year which ended in a whimper for the telecom spectrum auction the much touted biggest spectrum auction proved to be a stupendous failure marring the spirit of the industry reliance jio launched its fourth generation 4g services in september offering free voice forever to sweeten the deal it threw in free data till the end of the year later extending it to march of 2017 voice is what telecom operators make their money on without that how does one survive in a market as price sensitive as india i assure you we will not lose money reliance industries chairman mukesh ambani told his shareholders while announcing the jio offer this was taking competition to a whole new level the free voice call offer by reliance for the 4g roll out was a major event it was disruptive rishi tejpal principal research analyst for telecom business strategy at gartner told ians jio s disruptive offer led to long queues at its outlets across the country but then in mobile telephony each network is dependent on the others for succesful completion of pan indian calls reliance jio found a new turf war in the making it accused incumbent players of not providing enough number of points of interconnection pois as expected the matter was dragged to the ministry level and the watchdog the telecom regulatory authority of india trai the regulator proposed a heavy penalty of rs 3 050 crore in all on bharti airtel vodafone india and idea cellular for violating licence norms by denying enough pois to reliance jio the issue of limited interconnection points as highlighted by reliance jio impacted the customer experience it wanted to give its customers tejpal said the gauntlet thrown by reliance jio was of course picked up there was no way out the three big telecom players in the country bharti airtel vodafone india and idea cellular brought in their own offers on free calls for pre paid customers the incumbents seem not to have lost comparable market share or seen a large movement of their customers to jio mahesh uppal director of consultancy firm com first told ianslosing market share is one thing losing revenue is another and a more serious matter there is sufficient evidence that attempts by incumbent mobile operators to match jio s aggressive pricing has dented their revenues significantly uppal adds the situation therefore would be a matter of concern for both sides he suggests the new year would decide who gets a bloody nose and who remains unscathed in this bruising fight by the end of september the number of wireless telephone subscribers in india had already crossed the one billion mark standing at 1 049 million according to trai data amidst the unhappiness over call drops and poor service often attributed to lack of enough telecom towers or adequate spectrum the government was very hopeful that its biggest spectrum auction would bring in substantial revenue and ease the problems the big hope was to raise rs 566 000 crore it got commitments of only rs 65 789 crore or 11 6 per cent of the desired figure with the auction ending within five days the government was warned by experts and the industry that the high reserve price the regulator chose and approved by the central government would not excite telecom operators but the government s sight was set on garnering revenue a total 2 354 mhz of spectrum was put on the block for e auctioning but only 965 mhz was sold or just 41 per cent of what was on offer the auction went through 31 rounds for seven bands 700 mhz 800 mhz 900 mhz 1 800 mhz 2 100 mhz 2 300 mhz and 2 500 mhz there were no takers for 700 mhz and 900 mhz as cautioned the spectrum auctions have successfully removed the long felt shortage for spectrum but failed to deliver the revenues that the exchequer had hoped to receive they reflect that companies do not find the powerful 700 mhz sufficiently attractive at the price the government expected the government will now need to review its plans for future auctions said uppal industry experts though say the service quality would improve with whatever was sold replenishing or adding to the kitty of the telecom players the operators also moved to tackle the call drop issue by planning to set up 60 000 telecom towers at a cost of rs 12 000 crore the industry has made consistent and significant efforts to optimise networks which have largely been completed with more than 200 000 sites being installed in the last 15 months for 2g and 3g services across the country since jan 1 2015 rajan s mathews director general cellular operators association of india coai told ians highlights of telecom industry in 2016 launch of reliance jio infocomm in september spectrum auction ended within five days with a total commitment of only rs 65 789 crore reliance communications and aircel merger that resulted in asset base of rs 65 000 crore reliance jio reliance communications got government s nod for spectrum sharing"

"new delhi riding on the free voice and data offers reliance jio infocomm s subscriber base may touch 100 million by march 2017 end said nitin soni director at fitch ratings however it may even shrink once the telecom operator starts charging its customers he added we think that jio is adopting a very sound strategy of offering free voice and text services and free data till the end of march to bolster its subscriber base they currently have 52 55 million subscribers and it could well increase to 100 million by end of march but we will need to remember that these are free services soni told btvi in an interview so as long as it is free even a customer who is a customer of airtel or idea will still take a free jio sim to enjoy free services for the next three months but i think there will be some churn when jio will start charging from april 1 and that churn may well reduce the subscriber base by 5 10 per cent he added launched in september jio was offering its customers free voice and data till december 31 2016 which it has now extended till march 31 2017 but i think at that time the price will be the sole determinant for a customer whether they want to shift to their second sim on jio or whether they want to retain their existing sim with the incumbent and at that time the customer will decide how much they are going to pay on a monthly basis to the telecom operator and if jio at that time is cheaper than the incumbents then they might as well shift to jio soni said but i think there will be a slew of other offers which we believe will come in the next three months to further attract subscribers and incumbents will obviously take efforts to retain their existing subscriber base and not allow their premium subscriber base to churn over to jio he added talking about consolidation in the telecom space soni said the telecom industry cannot afford more than four to five participants in the long run we also believe that reliance jio entry into the industry will hasten consolidation given the competitive intensity has notched quite high now and they have recently extended the offer to march 31 the consolidation has been going on we have seen reliance communications acquiring mts and then merging its operations with aircel and some of the weaker telcos are looking also to exit the market but we believe that there could be some more consolidation in the medium term said soni he said idea cellular could face a lot of challenges as it does not have 100 per cent 4g spectrum asset on a pan india basis they could also look to do some merger and acquisition activity to strengthen its competitive position and whenever a new entrant comes into this industry it negatively impacts the weaker telecom company first we believe that idea could be well affected in the next 12 24 months and which is the reason we think that they could do some m a activity to consolidate their position soni said fitch ratings views the outlook for the entire sector as negative for 2017 we believe that data tariff will fall by 15 20 per cent because of competitive intensity coming along from jio but airtel is a well established and entrenched incumbent in this market he said airtel with lot of spectrum asset on 900 mhz is well placed to compete against jio iansag vt"
"new delhi the telecom regulator has rejected vodafones claim that its recommendation to penalise the second largest indian carrier was out of its jurisdiction and said the companys plea challenging the penalty in court was to back up a separate case with the competition commission of india cci they have an oblique motive advocate meet malhotra representing the telecom regulatory authority of india in the matter with the delhi high court told et they have a matter pending before the cci and theyre using this to take some benefit there malhotra referred to reliance jio infocomms complaint to the cci last month where it alleged that vodafone india along with bharti airtel and idea cellular had formed a cartel against it and had not provided adequate points of interconnect pois required for calls to go through to other networks reliance jio is said to have cited trais october 21 recommendation to levy penalties of rs 1 050 crore each on vodafone india and bharti airtel and rs 950 crore on idea cellular for denying adequate pois to reliance jio which it said was equal to violating licence norms trai had slammed the telcos saying the move appeared to be aimed at stifling competition and was anti consumer and against public interest and had therefore recommended the harshest penalties vodafone approached the delhi high court on december 16 asking it to quash the recommendation or set it aside arguing that trais decision was beyond its jurisdiction and against the principles of natural justice malhotra said thursday that vodafones plea was not maintainable he told the court that incumbent telcos faced the same resistance from state run telcos bharat sanchar nigam ltd and mahanagar telephone nigam ltd when they started out and were now at the receiving end on jios entry trai will file an affidavit in court explaining its stand on how vodafones plea is not maintainable vodafone lawyer rishi agrawala told the court that trais recommendation was being misused and therefore vodafones plea should be heard urgently the court refused to grant vodafone an interim stay on the penalty recommendation and issued notices to the regulator and the department of telecommunications the latter for being made party to the matter which will now be heard on january 3 it will not be proper to comment because the matter is sub judice a vodafone spokesperson said on the court developments trais recommendations on the penalty have been sent to the telecom department which can refer them back to trai accept or scrap them altogether dot is taking legal opinion on the matter"

"vodafone has also said that no proper hearing was given to it by trai before issuance of recommendation of october 21 the court will hear the matter again on december 21 trai in its recommendation to the dot had said it has found vodafone to be non compliant with licence conditions and service quality norms given the high rate of call failures and congestion at interconnect points for rjio"

"we think that jio is adopting a very sound strategy of offering free voice and text services and free data till the end of march to bolster its subscriber base they currently have 52 55 million subscribers and it could well increase to 100 million by end of march but we will need to remember that these are free services soni told btvi in an interview"

"in june 2010 ril bought out the only winner of wireless spectrum across india infotel broadband services ltd for rs 4 800 crore approximately 1 billion then and has invested rs 1 lakh crore in the new business"
"analysts believe that while rjios entry will disrupt the mobile telephony market in india the company will not be profitable for the first five years due to capital expenditure mostly borrowed and interest and depreciation"
"it will in turn take a toll on rils profitability if rjio is not able to scale"
"prime minister narendra modi is expected"
"reliance industries ril chairman mukesh ambani on sunday said the rollout of reliance jios rjio fourth generation 4g high speed mobile broadband internet services will be in the second half on 2016 and will cover 80 per cent of indias 1 3 billion population"
"the delayed launch is being seen as helping rjio benefit from a stronger network before the rollout as it plans to buy liberalised spectrum from the anil ambani led reliance communications rcom in rajasthan karnataka kerala and tamil nadu accounting for a fourth of industry revenues"
"we would attribute any delay in launch to include the 850mhz in the network a later launch could thus mean a stronger network than was envisaged even four months ago said sunil tirumalai and chunky shah research analysts at credit suisse in a note on the indian telecom sector titled jio is moving from weakest to strongest spectrum portfolio"
"reliance jio has set sights on rcoms 850 mhz band spectrum in the four key circles mentioned above in which the government is likely to allow liberalising given no spectrum has been sold in these circles in the 850 mhz band"
"post this rjio is likely to get access to these bands through sharing trading deals taking their 850 mhz band coverage to the full country the total cost of liberalisation by rcom is 1 billion said the credit suisse note"
"for the first four years after acquiring spectrum in 2300 mhz band in 2010 rjios spectrum holding was seen as a significant weakness in their strategy relegating it to a pure play data operator"
"however over the past two years rjio has swiftly acquired large amounts of spectrum in the 1800 and 850 bands through auctions and sharing trading deals with rcom and is the only operator to hold pan india sub 1 ghz liberalised spectrum"
"rjio now holds about 30 per cent share of all liberalised spectrum as compared to 20 per cent held by bharti airtel rjio has delayed its launch by a couple of months as they want to fix all loopholes in the network based upon employee feedback before their commercial rollout said an industry insider on december 27 2015 rjio started offering its 4g services to its employees"
"set sights on rcoms 850 mhz band spectrum"
"the ambani brothers mukesh and anil have got a glowing report from credit suisse and clsa for their respective telecom companies telcos in its latest report credit suisse says reliance jio is turning out to be a strong threat to incumbents while clsa has rated anil ambanis reliance communications rcom as outperform thanks to the companys decision to reduce its debt by up to 60 per cent by selling tower assets"
"credit suisse said its evaluation of rjios 4g network and its first instalment of services revealed that its network in urban areas is at par with others"
"it assessed rjios 4g field trials in and around mumbai after the company began beta testing by issuing connections to employees and friends"
"rjio network is turning out to be as strong a threat to incumbents as we had feared the credit suisse report published on monday said"
"next focus would be on pricing and marketing execution we see the market being surprised negatively on telco stocks"
"rcom meanwhile has been rated outperform by clsa and its share price revised to rs 90 a share implying a valuation of 3 4 billion for its tower assets"
"anil ambanis rcom is also likely to benefit from mukesh ambanis rjio services according to clsa in addition to multiple infrastructure sharing deals with reliance jio towers and fiber rcom is also finalising a spectrum sharing and trading deal with reliance jio for its 800mhz spectrum"
"this deal with rcom is crucial as it would ensure a pan india footprint on 800mhz thus boosting its 4g lte services the report said"
"rcom had recently signed a term sheet with tillman and tpg for the sale and leaseback of its 43 400 towers held by its 95 per cent subsidiary reliance infratel while this is non binding the deal appears inevitable given rcoms compulsions to deleverage and the quality of the assets according to clsa analysts"
"reliance jio plans to spend another rs 1 lakh crore in the next four years to expand after a majority of calls on its network are seen failing due to interconnection and portability issues with incumbent telcos"
"jio has already spent rs 1 5 lakh crore on its infrastructure investments of additional rs 1 lakh crore will be made by 2020 in expanding our network v srikanth joint chief financial officer said"
"a total of rs 2 5 lakh crore investments have been committed for digital india by our chairman a part of the investments will be made in rolling out optic fibre to homes the additional funds will come mostly from internal accruals"
"reliance industries the parent of reliance jio has seen its debt mount to rs 1 89 132 crore from rs 1 80 388 crore as on march 31 2016"
"reliance jio said that the telecom regulatory authority of india has stated that the tariff plans offered by it are fully compliant with regulatory norms for iuc are non predatory and non discriminatory"
"dea cellular indias third largest mobile operator offered its high speed fourth generation 4g mobile phone services across south india on wednesday ahead of rival reliance jios long awaited debut"
"the aditya birla group company will start offering services in all five southern states andhra pradesh karnataka kerala tamil nadu and telangana covering 75 towns in the first phase by december 31 2015"
"reliance jio will conduct a soft launch of its services limited to employees on december 27 the eve of the birth anniversary of reliance industries founder dhirubhai ambani"
"with this offering idea will become the sole operator in 41 of the 75 towns to offer 4g services market leader bharti airtel and vodafone india are present in the remaining towns"
"major towns to be covered under ideas 4g lte services are kochi hosur kadapa malapuram madurai mysore rajahmundry tiruchirappalli tirunelveli tiruppur vijayawada and vishakhapatnam"
"belgaum calicut cuddalore chitradurga guntur kakinada kancheepuram and trichur will follow by december 31 2015 said a company statement"
"idea will expand 4g services in all southern metros and large towns including bengaluru chennai hyderabad thiruvananthapuram mangalore and coimbatore by march 2016"
"worldwide 4g technology is gaining widespread acceptance with global 4g subscriptions crossing the 1 billion mark the launch of idea 4g lte services will further expand ideas wireless broadband network and propel the brand to an even higher growth trajectory said himanshu kapania managing director idea cellular"
"idea is also gearing to launch 4g services by march 2016 in other key markets namely madhya pradesh chhattisgarh maharashtra goa punjab haryana north east and orissa in a phased manner"
"by june 2016 ideas 4g footprint will cover 750 cities across 10 telecom circles we have 170 million consumers and expect the number to grow significantly after our 4g launch mr kapania told the hindu"
"idea cellular holds 1800 mhz 4g spectrum in these 10 telecom circles which cover 50 per cent of the telecom market and bring in over 60 per cent of ideas gross revenue"
"recently idea signed an agreement with videocon telecommunications limited for acquiring right to use 1800 mhz spectrum under spectrum trading agreement in two of its key telecom leadership markets of gujarat and uttar pradesh west post completion of this transaction 4g services will be extended to 12 service areas covering 75 per cent of ideas revenue base in the country"
"idea customers with 4g devices in these 75 towns can now start experiencing superfast speeds by upgrading their existing sim cards to new 4g sim cards said the statement"
"idea has also partnered with leading handset manufacturers and e commerce retailers for special data bundling offers on new 4g smart phones"
"the telecom regulatory authority of india recommended a hefty penalty of rs 3 050 crore on top three telcos airtel vodafone and idea for violating their license agreement and denial of interconnection to new player reliance jio"
"in similar letters to the three operators the authority said it is evident that airtel vodafone and idea are in non compliance of the terms and conditions of license and denial of interconnection to rjil appears to be with ulterior motive to stifle competition and is anti consumer"
"this development comes on the back of a prolonged battle between the mukesh ambani groups new telecom venture jio and these incumbent operators with the former alleging that its subscribers were unable to make calls to other networks as other operators were not providing adequate inter connection points"
"stating that the act of idea airtel and vodafone is against public interest the authority said non compliance of terms and conditions of the telecom licence warrants a recommendation for the revocation of the licence"
"however the authority is mindful of the fact that revocation of the license will entail significant consumer inconvenience and therefore in view of the larger public interest involved the authority recommends a penal action of rs 50 crore per lsa where point of interconnect congestion exceeded the allowable limit of 0 5 per cent"
"while the recommended fine for airtel and vodafone amounts to rs 1 050 crore for 21 service areas all expect jammu and kashmir for idea the penalty has been suggested for 19 service areas all except for himachal pradesh jammu and kashmir and northeastern states at rs 950 crore"

"before the ecommerce giants took their ad wars to the front pages of major news dailies in the country there were the telecom battles while the likes of flipkart amazon and snapdeal have stolen a bit of their limelight yet the telecom category is one of the biggest spenders and the most exciting in the country it has given us some of indian advertising s most iconic and also its most exasperating campaigns from sirji and adorable mutts to 4g girls you can read all about them and how they came to be unleashed upon this world in these pages what we also discovered along the way is that it s not easy being a telecom marketer they re usually the target of subscribers wrath and worse questions about everything from free calls to how much porn we watch the major telecom players have come a long way from the days of cheaper call rates to free sms and incoming to now calls for free the reliance jio launch is being touted to be the big game changer for the category and for the players data is going to be the next battle ground as the war horses get into formation power up folks and we ll give you a ring side view of all the action too open for its own good as its competition rehashes old concepts airtel prefers to trudge down paths unknown bravery or folly in june this year airtel india s largest telecom provider declared itself the open network depending on who you talk to this was either a leader acknowldging its failings and showing an eagerness to correct them or a colossal misstep the brand waving a red flag at the perennially wrathful herd of mobile subscribers what being an open network meant was giving subscribers a deeper insight into airtel s workings allowing them to see not just where the network was doing well but why it was not up to scratch near their home college workplace or commute it invited average joe subscribers to get in touch and work to improve the service in ads written with a candour that s rare in the typically hyperbolic and self congratulatory space of advertising the copy on one ad read while we are brutally honest about admitting we are not the best yet we re also fiercely passionate about getting there tell us where we are going wrong and partner us to make it right said another the films featured irate consumers venting about airtel before being mollified by seeing the entire expanse of airtel s network in its war room shot on location at manesar and yes in case you were wondering they were real consumers according to rajiv mathrani chief brand officer at airtel there was no scripted testimonial which is typically what a brand would do all we did was get the right set of customers to showcase different parts of india and the problems they had i don t think you will see them in multiple commercials phase 2 of the campaign in september showed complaints being responded to cell towers installed and happily ever after conclusions to at least a few network and buffering problems it s a project that airtel and its agency taproot dentsu regard as way more than a simple ad campaign even if there are several people who beg to differ but we ll get to them in a bit one that began nine months before the communication rolled out according to harmeen mehta global chief information officer airtel we took being transparent as a pledge the best intel we get on how we are doing is from consumers we decided it s not enough to listen to them more it s about listening to them all the time it was not a decision that was taken lightly angello dias co founder taproot dentsu fully expected the campaign one that by its very nature highlighted the warts in airtel s offering to be the place where a marketer could conceivably draw the line he recalls there were endemic problems that were not going away like call drops but the category was in denial in communication terms creating ads that did not address these issues and so the decision as the leader to take these head on instead of going the typical consumer delight route the fulcrum for open network was engineering the team created a site that would layer different technologies to display towers across the country and give an update on signal strength accessible to subscribers online and via mobile the backend mehta points out was the same airtel used internally for planning optimisation and quality management and according to airtel the results have been very encouraging call centre employees instantly know if it s the network at fault or the consumer phone settings that need tweaking mehta says our executives believe they ve become intelligent advisors over 70 of issues get addressed in one single call airtel puts a timeline for the resolution of the 30 which may involve a visit by a network engineer and seeking the consumer s feedback and help on placing a site or tower it involved increasing the number of on field engineers by a thousand so far over six million unique visitors have hit the website over 30 000 cellphone sites have been optimised and over 9 000 towers upgraded says mathrani ever since it launched though the campaign has its share of sceptics and who can blame them strangers have bonded friendships been forged and who knows people have probably got hitched over their my terrible network stories dias claims he deals with sceptics these days by directing them to the open network site so they can see for themselves the satisfied testimonials and accounts from happy customers but there are others who wonder whether the strategy is right for instance ex adman tarun chauhan founder of tsc consulting i think it was something they did to respond to jio it s a typical my shirt is cleaner than yours fmcg battle a strategic misstep says chauhan who has worked on telecom through stints at lowe lintas and jwt the entire game is creating perceived value rational value is very difficult to justify in this segment all it takes is meeting one person who says it doesn t work it s the reason operators across the world appeal to the heart and not the head besides chauhan argues in a category that s so inherently complicated access to information is unlikely to help i don t care if i have a cell tower on my head or my ass as long as it works if you say i have eight cell towers i ll say that s good because i don t know any better if you say i ve got 12 i ll say the same thing he believes a brand as big and synonymous with the category as airtel should not have to justify its existence via such a campaign marketing consultant harish bijoor sees in the campaign the stance a leader ought to take airtel has changed the strategic direction from you versus me to let us solve this together he however feels it has a limited lifespan having said it once the efficacy of the statement ceases and the novelty is gone it s a problem similar to old avis line about being number two and trying harder being open and giving a ringside view to a struggle is great at one level but at another it leaves people with the impression you are always struggling before closing this story i trawled through the facebook pages of all the major telecom operators right below the latest campaigns and

"Smartphone shipments in India have grown at an all-time record high in Q3, 2016. The shipments grew 23 percent as compared to global markets which grew only five percent. Part of the success is attributed to Reliances commercial launch of its affordable Jio 4G services. The launch has not only made people embrace internet even more heartedly but also led to a rise in demand of VoLTE-enabled smartphones almost by double.Launch of Reliance Jio 4G services back in September this year has boosted consumer demand in smartphones that support the voice over long-term evolution (VoLTE). Given the affordability factor of Jio services, with monthly tariffs starting at as low as Rs 149, the demand for VoLTE devices has surged. According to Counterpoint Research report, almost seven out of every 10 smartphones shipped were LTE capable, while eight out of every 10 LTE capable smartphones were VoLTE ready. In the July-September quarter, over 14 million VoLTE smartphones were shipped which were catalyzed by the launch of Jio services. In contrast, only 8 million VoLTE phones were shipped in the April-June quarter.While the demand for VoLTE smartphones has risen in India, the research points out that the growth of Chinese brands have prompted a lot of first-time smartphone users to upgrade to affordable but better spec smartphones. This has been possible because of Chinese brands adopting a direct and exclusive e-commerce channel strategy to be cost competitive. Though due to intense competition in the online channels where growth was saturating, during this quarter we saw a significant shift among these Chinese brands expanding to multiple e-commerce platforms as well as offline channels backed with strong promotions and a refreshed portfolio. Now Chinese brands contribute to almost one in three smartphones sold during the quarter, Pavel Naiya, Analyst at Counterpoint, commented on Q3 2016 market and vendor performance.Though, out of all the smartphones being sold, almost 70 percent of them are now LTE capable with 80 percent of those LTE smartphones sporting VoLTE (Voice over LTE) capabilities signaling a significant polarization among the Indian demographics, Karn Chauhan, Research Analyst at Counterpoint Research said.

Reliance has adopted this technology for its Jio network which supports only VoLTE calling and offers free phone calls for life. For consumers, it essentially translates into better call quality at an affordable rate. To a consumer in tier III and tier IV cities or lower down, VoLTE means free calls  because of Reliance Jio  thats why we see more demand coming compared to urban and tier 1and 2 cities, said Pankaj Rana, head of smartphones business at Panasonic, Economic Times reported. Although VoLTE as a premium feature had been limited to only high-end smartphones, with the introduction of Jio, more manufacturers are aiming to introduce smartphones which offer support for the technology at a pocket-friendly price tag. Reliance introduced its range of LYF smartphones which come with 4G VoLTE support much before it commercially launched the Jio 4G services. This has helped the company target population even in smaller towns and cities which aspire to get their hands on newer technology without spending much. With the LYF smartphones priced as low as Rs 2,999, the company is also bundling its Jio services with the devices to make it an even cheaper deal for the end consumer who tends to believe that the company is essentially selling a smartphone with premium specs bundled with free calling service. Counterpoint Research report further points that the combination of Reliances Jio launch and the range of LYF smartphones helped the brand climb up the ladder and stand at number fourth in smartphone shipments share in India at 6.9 percent, beating Xiaomi at 6.4 percent. ALSO READ: Smartphone shipments in India grew 23 percent in Q3 2016: Counterpoint Research With the launch of Jio services, we expect VoLTE capability to be a default functionality in smartphones and the ASP (average selling price) can penetrate sub-$50 (Rs 3,300) price band which will further drive the adoption, Tarun Pathak, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, further added. The growth in demand for VoLTE devices isnt the only factor that has contributed to the Indian market stand out globally. The research found that the Indian mobile phone industry also witnessed an uptick in feature phone shipments which still drives a sizeable population which is yet to ride the smart phone bandwagon. The research found that feature phone shipments grew two percent year-on-year and 23 percent quarter-on- quarter as feature phone to smartphone transition slowed down in recent quarters."
"The focus has shifted from voice to data as far as telecommunications go. In the last couple of years, there has been a lot of hue and cry in India about how the successor of 3G services, 4G will dominate the year 2015.  With 4G, specifically Long Term Evolution (LTE), one can expect theoretical data download speeds of up to 40 Mbps on mobile handsets. This means, watching a live football game on your handset will be distortion and lag-free. Moreover, blazing speeds will also pave an efficient way to services including VoIP, streaming video, and video calls. The handsets are there Undoubtedly, phone makers seem to be on track and have diverted their attention towards 4G. Evidently, we can see the commitment towards bringing 4G devices in India. In the past couple of weeks, weve seen Lenovo A6000, Oppo R5,  Xiaomi Note 4G, Micromax Yu Yureka, and one thing that is common among them is that they all support 4G.  Xiaomi, known for its flash sales, has opted to team up with Airtel, encouraging users to shift to 4G. Airtel is ready to offer 4G plans at 3G prices for the device. Gionee has also announced that starting 2015, all its smartphones priced above Rs 10,000 will feature LTE. Micromax Yureka Most companies had started testing 4G devices last year, and if the chatter online is to be believed, then many have started working at bringing low-cost budget 4G devices to India. Microsoft is ready to launch its low-cost Lumia 735 LTE handset here while Huawei plans to bring its 4G devices priced under Rs 10,ooo to India by mid-2015. What about the network? Mediatek, known to power most budget devices entering Indian market, had also unveiled its 4G LTE chipset, the MT6595, to take on its rival Qualcomms Snapdragon 800 chipset family. Last year, it hoped to sell around 300 million chips, out of which 30 million would be 4G LTE chips. It expects the number to increase in 2015 and 2016 with more markets including India transitioning to 4G LTE technology. However, even if companies churn out 4G devices, a dime a dozen, it wouldnt really matter unless proper 4G infrastructure and services are in place. Sure, getting a 4G enabled phone, specially when it is being offered at affordable rates, is a good way to future-proof your investment. But barring few lucky cities, 4G is yet to be seen across India. Surprisingly, even our commercial capital, Mumbai, hasnt tasted the 4G experience yet. Industry speaks At the current bandwidth, users are not able to enjoy uninterrupted video streaming. We are hoping that 4G will be introduced in the country at the earliest possible time. Some service providers have already started gearing up to launch 4G services in the country. This is an exciting time for smartphone makers like us who are committed to delighting users with innovative devices. Our smartphones, namely Oppo R5, Oppo Find 7 and Oppo Find 7A are all 4G/LTE compatible devices. We plan to introduce more 4G enabled devices this year, said Tom Lu, CEO, Oppo Mobiles India. While everyone was expecting a proper 4G rollout to more cities in India in late-2014 and a further boost as we entered 2015, it looks like we will have to wait until mid-2015 to see some real action on a pan-India level. At the moment, there is still no clarity on when 4G will be rolled out in the country but given the honourable Prime Ministers Digital India dream, both broadband and 4G are likely to be given huge boost this year. We dont see a reason to get involved in the 4G space as this seems well catered for by the incumbent players. However, we plan to partner with these operators within our Wi-fi strategy to allow data offload where possible to assist network operators with the huge growth of data consumption, said Nigel Eastwood, CEO, New Call Telecom. Lenovo A6000 will compete with the likes of Redmi 1S, Yureka, etc. Recently launched Lenovo A6000 4G smartphone will compete with the likes of Redmi 1S, Yureka, etc. Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, bought 1800 MHz spectrum in a number of circles in last years February auctions. This means, they can deploy 4G services using FDD-LTE technology anytime. The global ecosystem around 4G FDD-LTE is far more developed than the other LTE technology, TD-LTE. However, only Aircel and Airtel have managed to launch 4G services in a limited way in select cities. The roadblocks As per auction conditions, the successful bidders are required to provide 90 percent coverage in metro areas, if they have spectrum there, and 50 percent of rural area within five years. If a company fails to meet roll-out conditions, spectrum will be taken back. However, telecom industry body COAI had requested the Department of Telecom to extend deadline for roll out of 4G services to 2020 citing various hurdles, mainly delay in development of technology and regulatory procedures. The inability of the operators to even launch the services on the allocated spectrum is primarily on account of delay in development of the requisite device and network ecosystem, a prime factor which is predominantly out of the control of telecom service providers, COAI had said. This could be the possible reason why telcos like Airtel and Reliance Jio couldnt launch services as promised last year in September.  Last year, in September, Airtel was said to be brining its 4G services to Mumbai and Delhi, but they have been a no-show yet. Airtel currently offers its 4G services through dongles and mobile devices.  A report early last year had hinted that Reliance Jio was almost building up team for its telecom services that was likely to be launched in the third quarter of 2014 (July-September period) starting from Delhi and Mumbai. Oppo R5 is not only a slim phone but also comes with 4G LTE capability Oppo R5 is not only a slim phone but also comes with 4G LTE capability OEMs quite optimistic Despite this, OEMs seem quite optimistic about 4G growth in India in 2015. Sudhin Mathur, Director, Smartphones, Lenovo India who also believes budget 4G is the next upcoming trend said, According to a recent report by PwC, India is expected to have 10-15 million subscribers of 4G LTE by December 2015. Airtel has already launched 4G in 16 cities and Aircel holds TD-2300MHz 4G spectrums in eight circles. Besides this, Reliance with a pan-India license aims to cover 700 cities (including 100 high-priority markets) in this year. We will also see multiple players launching 4G on a more efficient 1800 MHz spectrum.  At the same time, India is expected to have a mobile Internet user base of 480 million by 2017 and as a result the demand for high speed mobile Internet is also expected to accelerate further. We expect the year 2015 to be a game-changer for the telecom industry with the 4G services being rolled out across the country on a massive scale. There is no denying the fact that India will be the largest smartphone market in the world by the end of this decade. The country already has the fastest growing mobile internet base across the world and is poised to become the second largest country (by user base) across the world by end 2015. And therefore, as more and more smartphones are made available in the market, the demand for mobile internet is going to increase by leaps and bounds, adds Oppos Lu. How the players currently stand Reliance Industries is known to be announcing the commercial launch of its 4G telecom service of RJio in 2015 entailing investments of Rs 70,000 crore. RJio will initially cover about 5,000 towns and cities accounting for over 90 percent of urban India, as well as over 215,000 villages in India and the target is to expand this to over 600,000 villages. It is the only one with pan-India spectrum availability. The telco at the forefront at launching 4G services in India has been Bharti Airtel so far, covering circles like Nasik, Pune, Panchkula, Bangalore and more. Vodafone, it seems, is focussing on expanding its 3G coverage amidst the surging data growth. However, some reports had pointed at the companys plan of testing 4G services in five circles, namely, Delhi, Karnataka, Kerala, Kolkata and Mumbai, wherein it won 5 MHz or more of airwaves in the 1800 MHz band last year. However, another report pointed out that the  operations will begin only when cheaper 4G mobile devices are readily available."
"Ever since Reliance Jio made its debut in Indian telecom sector, demand for 4G VoLTE (Voice over Long Term Evolution) supportive devices has doubled, suggests a report on Economic Times. Also, India has made 23 percent growth in smartphone shipments setting a all-time high record in Q3 for the year 2016. Another factor catalyzing the growth is also credited to Reliance Jio providing affordable 4G services through its Welcome Offer. Also, Reliance partnered with several companies to make avail VoLTE enabled devices to a huge part of telecom consumers. During July and September quarter, more than 14 million VoLTE smartphones were shipped due to the lucrative launch of Jio services. The number remained only 8 million for the April-June quarter. Interestingly, the demands are high in rural areas, accredited to Reliance Jio offering free calling for lifetime over VoLTE only. Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities have reported more growth as compared to Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. This growth also comes at a time when Chinese smartphone makers have recorded tremendous growth in Indian markets, as these manufactures provide affordable and effective specifications to smartphone users. Reliance Jio uses VoLTE bands both for data and calling, which means voice calling over internet is interpreted as free call for general consumers. (ALSO READ: TRAI proposes Rs 3,050 crores penalty to Airtel, Vodafone and Idea for not providing interconnect points to Jio) Reliance also launched LYF phones equipped with 4G VoLTE support ahead of its Jio 4G services launch. This enabled the company expand its consumer base, even in smaller towns. These phones were made available at a starting price of Rs 2,999 bundled with Jio services. With the launch of Jio services, we expect VoLTE capability to be a default functionality in smartphones and the ASP (average selling price) can penetrate sub-$50 (Rs 3,300) price band which will further drive the adoption, said Tarun Pathak, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research as reported on ET."
"The Indian telecom market is abuzz with talk about the 4G network. The excitement has been fueled by the impending launch of Reliance Jio  billed as the largest greenfield investment in Indian history  and the aggressive rollout and marketing of competing 4G networks by incumbent players. From a subscriber standpoint, they are mainly concerned about the quality and speed of data connectivity and not the underlying network technology. However, operators do need to make the right technology choices to determine their spectrum, network and device roadmaps, strategies and investments. It is important to note that Indian operators invested significantly in 3G network and spectrum from 2010 to 2015. Slow uptake of 3G in India means a lot of that investment has not yet been fully recovered. A pertinent question therefore is whether the market will support both 3G and 4G networks and what the future holds for 3G once 4G gains traction. Global trends Globally, as wireless data traffic continues to grow, operators have focused on deploying the more efficient 4G technology, also called LTE (Long Term Evolution). Since the launch of iPhone 5 in 2012, 4G smartphone ecosystem has evolved rapidly and most new smartphones sold in developed markets operate on 4G networks. Availability of network and devices has led to rapid growth in 4G subscribers and corresponding decline in 3G customer base in US, Europe and even China. As 4G becomes the dominant option, some operators are considering shutdown of their 3G networks to simplify their architectures, e.g., Verizon in 2017 and Telenor in 2020. However, this is happening in countries where typically 3G networks have been in operation for almost 15 years. As a result, they have had adequate time to monetize the spectrum and network. On the other hand, developing countries like Indonesia, Thailand, etc. continue to focus on 3G, even though they have launched 4G networks. Operators and regulators, for now, are aligned on the need to monetize 3G investments and are looking for a slow migration to 4G networks. India too was in a similar stage of evolution until 2015 and even 5 years after launch, 3G penetration was less than 10%. One key reason was that smartphones and 3G data pricing were both expensive. No wonder, we had 300 million internet users of which 180 million had smartphones, but only 90 million bought 3G plans. The high-volume, low-price model that drove voice growth was nowhere in sight. Even the operators had only 5MHz of expensive spectrum deployed on 3G and were going slow on 4G. Changing landscape However, last 6 months have seen a dramatic change in the view on future evolution of the market. We believe that India is in a unique situation and can become one of the first few countries to move to a 4G + 2G network combination and shutdown 3G. Key catalyst of course is Reliance Jio, whose launch is now imminent in 2016  a greenfield LTE only network with pre-launch investment of $20 billion  something unprecedented in any country. Key reasons for my view are as below. First, 4G will have much higher coverage and capacity than 3G by end 2016. RJio promises an LTE network to provide 90% population coverage at launch deploying upto 35 MHz of spectrum. Incumbent operators are also responding by aggressively investing in 4G spectrum and network. Across operators in each circle, a total of approximately 75 MHz of spectrum is likely to be deployed on 4G networks compared to only 25 MHz on 3G. Second, such large fixed capacities will lead to lower 4G data pricing. While uncertain, pricing is likely to be closer to current 2G data pricing to drive adoption and scale economies. Third, device ecosystem is rapidly moving towards 4G. In Q4 CY15, smartphones shipments in India exceeded feature phones and 4G smartphones exceeded 3G phones. Price points are dropping sharply and 4G smartphones will be available for less than $50 within 2016. Voice over LTE, a technology that allows for high quality calls on 4G networks, is also stabilizing and will be default by next year. By 2018, we expect almost 75% of devices sold in India will be smartphones, mostly 4G. Fourth, at 9%, India has very low penetration of 3G unlike some other markets. A large number of these 90 million subscribers will move to 4G with their next handset upgrade. Most new customers will enter on 4G, driven by high decibel marketing campaigns of all operators. Sharp decline in 3G subscribers will stretch the economics of running 3G networks. Last but not the least, spectrum in India is very limited and expensive. 3G spectrum that operators bought in 2010 is valid till 2030 and can also be used for LTE. This will allow operators to drive economies of scale through a more simplified network architecture, reduce their cost per site and offer lower price to customers. Preferred choice With overwhelming advantage on technology, coverage, devices and pricing, we expect 4G to become the preferred choice for smartphone consumers. Many 3G networks in India could be shutdown and India may be one of the first 2G + 4G market by 2019. This of course has a huge implication for India. Operators and other players in the value chain need to make LTE central to their plans and ensure the 3G equipment and services can be seamlessly migrated to 4G or be at risk of holding stranded assets and playing catchup. Developments in India also have a high impact on other emerging countries. With its scale, India provides a platform for development of low cost operating models. If both China and India shift to 4G, it will lead to rapid growth in low priced ecosystem for LTE devices and equipment and move the economies of scale away from 3G to 4G. This can put pressure on other developing countries in APAC, LATAM and Africa to migrate to 4G sooner than they may have planned."
"18% QoQ growth registered with cumulative devices shipments touching 18.2 million in 2Q16 Samsung, Micromax and LYF are the top three LTE devices players with 40%, 9% and 8% market shares, respectively. Time ripe for Apple to ship promised VoLTE enabled iPhones that would work on Reliances Jio network. Second tier of handset manufacturers like Vivo, Oppo, LeEco, Gionee, OnePlus and InFocus to double their 4G shipments to meet the surge in demand as Jio goes live. 4G Smartphones continue to dominate the space, however, CMR expects data cards and tablets to double their shares and contribute between 3-4% to the overall LTE devices shipment by the year-end. Gurugram: As per the CMRs 2Q CY 2016 report of India LTE Devices, over 18.2 million 4G devices were shipped in the second quarter of 2016 as against 15.4 million in the first quarter. Of these, 97.8% were Smartphones followed by DataCards at 1.6% and Tablet PCs at 0.6%. Samsung still rules the market with about 40% market share, beating Lenovo, Micromax and LYF took the second and third positions with 9% and 8% market shares, respectively. However, as trends suggest post April 2016, shipments of LYF devices are witnessing a decline and it may not remain a leading brand in the coming quarters.  However, its share into tablets is likely to increase that would also give a fillip to Mi-Fi devices, where Jio is selling Huaweis Mi-Fi devices. CMR's India LTE Devices Report 2Q CY 2016_Fig2 In the mobile phones, Samsung, Micromax and LYF are the three leaders with 41%, 8.62 % and 8.54% market shares, respectively.  In tablets, Samsung held 40% market share, Apple was at second position with 30.79% market share and iBall was ranked number 3 with 8.3% share.  However, within DataCards, Samsung, ZTE, Micromax and iBall were the only players shipping 4G devices in the 2Q of 2016. With the top three players holding 63.39%, 20.02%, 16.43%, markets shares, respectively. In the backdrop of declining LYF Smartphone shipments and with enablement of almost all leading brands for provisioning of Jio services and the services actually going live, it is high-time for the second tier brands like Vivo, Oppo, LeEco, Gionee, OnePlus, Asus and InFocus to double their shipments to meet the expected rise in demand.  Of this, LeEco and OnePlus should also get their devices work on the Jio networks. CMR's India LTE Devices Report 2Q CY 2016_Fig1 Commenting on the findings, Faisal Kawoosa, Principal Analyst for Telecoms at CMR, said, Now the equation is reversed. First, all handset vendors wanted to ride on the expected 4G wave.  With services becoming live, it will be now more of a concern for operators, especially Jio (since it is a 4G only network) to actually see the ecosystem gets widened and encourage more and more handset players to come onboard and ramp up their shipments. The biggest challenge for Jio would be to double the users actually having a 4G device in hand.  We expect this year to end with around 125 million cumulative 4G devices and Jio would want this base to touch 250-300 million by 2017 end. Only then, it can expect some decent numbers (70-80 million) of subscribers on Jio services of this potential base by the end of 2017, Faisal added. CMR Analyst for Telecoms, Krishna Mukherjee, commenting on the 4G LTE brands in India said, While in the Smartphone space, we may see about 25-30 4G Smartphone models with different variant getting launched in the second half of this year and content and video consumption getting a boost with 4G. And to fulfill the tremendous demand for 4G, the second tier of handset brands such as Vivo, Oppo, LeEco, Xiaomi, having created a niche for them in the India market, should explore more and take on the 4G wave. 4G LTE is here now to turnaround the tablets and data cards market as more and more players see this arena as the potential cash cows of the future. Not only domestic, but global brands should also look at this space to yield maximum profit from this unexplored space. In a nutshell, after the success in Smartphones, 4G is likely to revitalize the tablets and data cards segments and so, they could be the next destination for success, Krishna concluded."
"After creating havoc in the telecom sector with the launch of Relaince Jio, Mukesh Ambani now seems to have his eyes set on the e-wallet industry as the country moves towards a digital economy at a rapid pace. Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani today announced that Jio Money will be starting a merchant application called Merchant Solutions on December 5. Jio Money will enable digital transactions of all types, whether they be at small shops or restaurants, railway ticket counters, for bus and mass transit and even for person-to-person money transfers, Ambani said. Jio Money will aim at reaching a mark of 10 million downloads in the coming months, Ambani said. The Merchant Solutions will enable both low-value high-volume transactions. Ambani also used the stage to praise Prime Minister Narendra Modi's move to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. I would like to congratulate Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji's bold and historic decision to demonetize old currency"
" he said. Digitally-enabling transactions will boost economic growth, while bringing unprecedented transparency and accountability, he added. Ambani's announcement could result in tough competition for existing digital wallet companies such as Paytm, Freecharge and Airtel's pilot Payment banks in Rajasthan. Paytm has registered 50 million downloads on the Play Store and has used the demonetisation to its benefit after the government's decision to deemonetise Rs 500, Rs 1000 bank notes. Given the nuanced situation of e-wallets as an industry, more and more players are aiming to fill the vacuum left behind by the demonetised cash. "
"Relaince Jio free services offer for the next three months has led to a massive rush with people thronging Reliance Digital and other telecom stores, but not everyone's been able to get a sim. The Reliance Jio 'Free Welcome Offer' was launched on Monday September 6th for free services up till December 31st after which the services turn paid.To get a SIM card all you need is an ID proof, address proof and passport photographs and head to the nearest telelcom store. But turns out you need a couple of weeks and a lot of patience as well.  Long queues are visible in stores, with people eagerly waiting to get a sim and make the most of the free services, reports say. According to reports by India Today Tech from a Reliance Digital Store in a mall in Noida, thousands of people have already registered for Jio sim card, but more people are waiting for their turn. 4"
"600 people have registered till Sept 9. More are coming every minute"
" was a response from the store attendant. He added saying that there were 150 sims available this morning. The store was currently registering for September 12th. Doing a rough calculation, this translates to about 8 people chasing one Jio SIM card per day. And still not everyone would get a Jio SIM card by September 9th. Reports from another mall in Noida revealed that SIM card registrations were booked until October 26th. Jio has plans both for prepaid and postpaid services starting at Rs 19 and Rs 149 respectively. Mukesh Ambani revealed the Jio project on Friday at the shareholder's AGM where he announced that voice calling and national roaming would be free of charge. He also said that Jio would offer data rates at 1/10th of market rates, cheapest in the world. According to him, consumers can avail the SIM card provided they have a 4G compatible phone. "
"As Reliance Jio continues to add subscribers on its network, incumbent operators have started rolling out their 4G LTE services across various circles. However, one of the biggest advantages of Reliance Jio over other operators is that it is an All-IP network that supports voice over LTE (VoLTE) for HD voice calling. Not to be left behind, Airtel, Indias largest telecom operator is reportedly gearing up to launch its own VoLTE services. Airtel has already awarded Nokia with a $60 million (Rs 402 crore) deal to implement VoLTE technology in India. Earlier this year, Airtel had offered a small contract to Nokia for testing VoLTE technology in select circles. Now, citing people familiar with the development, ET reports that the service may be launched before the end of this year. Airtel was piloting the technology in a few areas and after successful testing, is now looking at a bigger launch by giving a pan-India contract for IMS (IP multimedia system) solution to Nokia, one of those people told the publication. In order to commercially go live with VoLTE, we would need to see how much VoLTE phones are live on our network,  Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal recently said. With 4G LTE, you can surf the internet and download content at high speeds. However, when making a phone call, the network falls back to 2G or 3G (analogue) cellular network. However, VoLTE allows telecom operators to transmit voice and data without having to switch between bands. VoLTE also lets you make HD voice calls with better clarity compared to 2G or 3G. And while Airtel currently uses circuit-switch technology for calling, industry watchers expect Airtel to switch to VoLTE pretty soon. In circles where VoLTE isnt available, calling could fall back to 2G and 3G. ALSO READ: Congratulations Jio for reaching 16 million users, now fix their problems first According to a recent Cybermedia Research report, demand for smartphones with VoLTE has doubled since Reliance Jio started its commercial operations in September. In the September quarter, an estimate of more than 14 million VoLTE-enabled smartphones were shipped to India, which is almost twice compared to the last quarter. To attract customers on its network, Reliance Jio has been offering unlimited high-speed internet, unlimited voice and video calls, and unlimited SMS. The telecom operator is also offering unlimited access to its range of content services which includes JioMovie, an on-demand movie streaming service, JioMusic, online music streaming service, JioTV, a live TV streaming service and more. This has already helped Reliance Jio add 16 million subscribers in record 26 days, but not without problems. Due to point of interconnection issue with incumbent telecom operators, as many as five million calls fail on a daily basis. Also, with more users added to the network, download speeds have also considerably dropped down. When we initially tested internet speed on the network, we used to get at least 15Mbps, but now even getting 2Mbps has become quite difficult. ALSO READ: Ooklas speedtest report shows Reliance Jios declining 4G internet speeds All this has already created a pressure on incumbent telecom operators who have already slashed their 4G data rates by offering more data at the same cost. As VoLTE calls and data is carried through the same network, it may also help telecom operators tackle the call drops situation. From a user point of view, besides better voice quality and high-speed internet, VoLTE also allows for better battery life. Vodafone and Idea Cellular, Indias second and third largest telecom operators could soon join the VoLTE race. While Vodafone India is already trying VoLTE in select circles and using Nokias IMS solution, Idea Cellular, on the other hand, is reportedly in advanced talks with Nokia and Ericsson for VoLTE equipment and service deployment."
"People waiting for hours in queues to get a Reliance Jio sim. You must have read about this everywhere ever since Reliance re-entered the telecom space with the launch of its much anticipated 4G network recently. With dirt cheap data plans and free voice calls till the end of the year, the outrageous offering of Jio has captured the imagination of the whole country. The craze is not just because of the low pricing, but also because of the incredible data speeds promised. It says that users can experience peak download speeds of up to an incredible 70 MBPS! Who wouldnt want that right?! How is it going to change the online video landscape? was a question that most people had on their minds right after news broke out. Through this article, Id like to share what I believe is going to happen in the online video space in the country over the next few months. reliance-jio-affect-Indian-online-video-ecosystem The controversy and the debate The response from rivals after the launch, as expected, was immediate. Bigger competitors like Airtel have been forced to reduce their 3G and 4G plans by almost 80 percent, while smaller counterparts like Aircel, Telenor and Tata Teleservices have their backs to the wall already. This has prompted an outright war in the $50 billion telecom industry, with accusations flying all around. Helmed by Indias richest man Mukesh Ambani, Jio has even been sardonically called a $20 billion startup by its competitors. The accusations arent just coming from one side of the street though. Reliance, which is at the receiving end of most of this flak, claims that ever since its launch, more than 5 crore calls by Jio customers to other networks have failed! Back in the mid 1990s, an outgoing call used to cost around Rs 35 per minute, and now Jio is offering free voice calls till the end of this year! Despite an exponential growth in mobile internet penetration in the last two years, the Indian telecom space is still voice-heavy. Thats exactly why this move could be a death knell for the telecom industry as we know it in the country. Almost all telecom operators in the country depend mostly on the revenue that they generate through voice calls. This price war effectively means that the revenue growth of the bigger rivals like Vodafone and Airtel will come down from 10 percent in 2015-16 to 5 percent in 2018-19. More video platforms will come to India Lack of original local programming, high price points and low consumer interest were some of the major deterrents to the entry of global streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime in India. Besides these, there was another major reason for their apprehension  slower and low quality internet speeds. Now, with millions of people projected to use Jios super-fast 4G connections in the next few months, some of the other major streaming platforms will also shift their focus to India to tap into one of the biggest customer baskets in the world. When more people have access to high quality internet, video platforms that are yet to arrive in the country will be more willing to throw their hats in the ring.Increase in VOD platform and OTT subscriptions When Netflix was launched in India in the beginning of 2016, I remember reading tons of articles on why it wouldnt work in India. Most of these articles cited reasons like  The Indian online consumer mindset (When one can download a movie/show through torrents, why would he/she opt for a paid subscription?) Lack of local programmes in the content library. Low broadband penetration and lack of quality internet speeds. Tackling the first two problems was never going to be a big deal. The spending capacity of the millennial generation in India is increasing all the time, and more and more people are willing to spend for stuff that they really want. And it is only a matter of time before Netflix buys the rights to local content and improves its local programming strategy. But the third issue was always going to be a big question mark for all the stakeholders in the industry. Jios launch is set to change that by providing not only cheap but quality 4G data connections to the general population. And because the connections are cheap, users will be more willing to spend some extra money on quality content that they can get through OTT subscriptions. Increase in advertising spend on OTTs In 2015, the revenue from OTT platforms globally was around $32.57 billion. Estimates suggest that this is set to almost triple to $96 billion by 2020! During the same time, revenue from TV advertising and subscriptions is projected to increase by just a fraction from $192 billion to $208 billion. India is definitely going to be an integral part of this whole scheme of things since it will have millions of people moving from slower internet connectivity to broadband and 4G. Lower internet speeds till now meant that people werent really interested in opting for an OTT subscription. And a low user base meant that brands werent really interested in advertising on these platforms; which in turn meant less revenue prospects for these OTTs. But now, with more people accessing high quality internet, the OTT user base is definitely set to increase, giving brands a reason to advertise to catch eyeballs. This would lend a little breathing space to these platforms, allowing them to spend some money on original programming. Another interesting prediction that I have is with regards to the consumption of video ads in the country. A major deterrent to online video advertising in India was their viewablity. Since video ads also consume high bandwidth, poor internet speeds here meant that people just hated watching them, especially on their mobile devices. The influx of fast 4G connections is probably going to help the situation a little. More digital first original programming content will be produced Even though online video penetration in India has increased in the last couple of years, if you analyse some of the biggest players in the market, you will come to realise that most of them are traditional video entities that are trying to tap into the growing digital user base. For instance  the biggest YouTube channel in India is T-Series, which mostly uploads video content that it already has for traditional mediums like TV. The number of web shows that are produced here is also really low when compared to the West. Even some of the biggest OTT platforms in the country like Hotstar and Voot depend mostly on video content from television. But now, with better internet infrastructure and more money seeping in, media and production houses will be more willing to produce digital first original programmes. reliance-jio-affect-Indian-online-video-ecosystem Investors will start pouring more money into the video domain Better internet infrastructure is going to give investors more confidence to put money not only in established OTT platforms, but also in promising upcoming players. The platforms will then have more financial freedom to reinforce their current strategies, bulk up their content libraries and commission new original programmes. This would benefit the whole video ecosystem in the country. Looking at how things played out in developed economies during the initial OTT boom, it is safe to assume that there will be a lot of aggressive acquisitions in the coming days as well. Just look at these examples: In 2014, AT&T had acquired Fullscreen, one of the biggest Multi Channel Networks on YouTube. Earlier this year, Verizon bought a 24.5 percent stake in Awesomeness TV, a digital video-focused company. SingTel, an Asian telecom giant, started an OTT HOOQ, which was a joint venture with Sony Pictures and Warner Bros in 2015. Itll be interesting to see if Jio acquires any of the existing OTT platforms in the country. Jio will strengthen its content game  Other than the aggressive pricing plans, Jio has also been strategically making moves in the content space. It has already inked agreements with top broadcasters and movie studio houses like Sony Pictures, Balaji Telefilms, Eros International and Zee Entertainment for video content on its platform. Providing cheap high speed internet along with a good video content library is a really smart move by Jio."

Meanwhile, telecom biggies like Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular have told the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) that they were willing to provide Reliance Jio a reasonable number of additional points of interconnections (PoIs). There has been no specification on the number of PoIs that would be given. Jio has said that the incumbent telcos havent provided adequate PoIs (used to connect calls from one telecom operator to another), which has resulted in its consumers facing huge call drops."
